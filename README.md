Abstract:
DSCI 100, the Introduction to Data Science course at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, BC, was first launched in January 2019. It was designed as a first experience for students to gain skills in the areas of assembling, analyzing, and interpreting data. The high level course outcome that we aim for is that by the end of the course, students will be able to implement a data science workflow, by reading data from a local or remote file, wrangling (managing) the data intelligently, and creating tables and/or figures that convey a justifiable story based on the data. The course also introduces students to the landscape of statistical questions, and focuses on teaching intuitive and established supervised and unsupervised methods to answer predictive and exploratory questions. Examples include k-nearest neighbour classification, k-nearest neighbour regression, linear regression and k-means clustering. Rich problems with real data sets are used throughout the course. Statistical inference for point estimates is introduced at the end of the course to motivate follow-on statistical courses where inference and generative models are explored in more detail.
